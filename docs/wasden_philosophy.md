## Background

Cary Wasden founded Caspian Securities in 1996. Managed money for large institutional clients including Sir John Templeton (founder of Templeton Funds). In 2006, Templeton invited Wasden to manage his personal funds directly. The 5-bucket system was created specifically for Templeton to systematize money management.

## The 5-Bucket Analysis Framework

The MOST IMPORTANT framework in the system. Created for Sir John Templeton. 94% of returns come from the first 3 buckets. The last 2 are where real alpha lives.

### Bucket 1: Instruments
- Equities (large value, growth, etc.) and fixed income (sovereign, corporate IG, muni, non-IG)
- **Trigger:** Risk-adjusted yield comparisons. US government bond at 4.8% vs. equity FCF yield of 3% = get out of stocks.
- The risk-free rate is the benchmark. Every additional risk should be compensated.
- **System implementation:** Compare equity FCF yield to 10yr Treasury. Surface as portfolio-level alert.

### Bucket 2: Countries
- Primary: United States, China/Hong Kong, Brazil, India, South Korea
- Requirements: Deep capital markets, rule of law, clear property rights, independent judiciary
- **Key insight:** Simply knowing which country to be in and choosing the two broadest indices gives dramatic outperformance.

### Bucket 3: Sectors
- 11 GICS sectors, sub-sector analysis is where the value is
- Use FCF yield + quality/growth fundamentals to determine sector allocation
- Industry group level (below sub-sector) doesn't tend to yield valuable information

### Bucket 4: Themes (Long-Term Structural)
- AI, aging populations, renewable energy/EVs, infrastructure spending
- Aging of China: "one of the more devastating economic events to happen in your generation"

### Bucket 5: Special Occasions / Special Situations
- Highest volatility, highest return bucket. Market is "just absolutely wrong."
- Requires long staying power OR clear catalyst identification
- Example: Crude oil at -$47/barrel during COVID — enormous winner once it normalized

**Return distribution:** Buckets 1-3 = 94% of returns. Buckets 4-5 = where "adult size money" is made.

## Core Disciplines

### Cash Flow Over Earnings
- FCF is Wasden's #1 favorite metric. Harder to manipulate than earnings.
- FCF Yield compared to bond yields for instrument selection (Bucket 1).
- FCF to Net Income > 1.0 = strong cash generation.

### The 5 Categories of Ratios ("99% of the story")
<!-- TODO: Fill from Weekender PDFs — Jared to verify categories -->
1. Valuation ratios (PE, PEG, FCF Yield)
2. Profitability ratios (ROE, ROC, margins)
3. Liquidity/leverage ratios (current ratio, D/E, interest coverage)
4. Growth/efficiency ratios (revenue growth, CCC)
5. Sentiment/positioning (short interest)

### On Pricing Power
- Need a competitive environment
- Balance sheet matters — how quickly a company can go from non-existence to success

### On Market Mispricing
- Costco at 55x earnings vs. historical ~20x — "something clearly out of whack"
- Markets require a "Minsky moment" — when people suddenly say "this is dumb"

### On Analyst Recommendations
<!-- TODO: Fill from KNOWLEDGE_BASE Section on analyst recs -->

## What Wasden Wants From AI

> "What I would like AI to do, especially here, is to find more that aren't obvious... if you can use AI to say I found 50 points or scenarios where the market may be very significantly misjudging prices."

The AI isn't just implementing existing rules — it's finding mispricings Wasden couldn't find manually. Special situations at scale.

## TODO (Joe/Jared)
- [ ] Extract detailed ratio theory from Weekender PDFs
- [ ] Document specific Bucket 1 threshold rules (exact FCF yield vs. bond yield triggers)
- [ ] Add historical examples of each bucket in action
- [ ] Document Wasden's views on position sizing and risk management
- [ ] Add sector rotation rules from Wasden's framework
- [ ] Capture "Sprinkle Sauce" screening criteria tied to each bucket
